Data Cleaning:
----------------

Steps

1.    clean names and select necessary variables

2.    rename the variables

3.    drop any rows with missing observations

4.    filter out the second row (contains comments about the columns)

5.    join all the datasets

6.    drop any rows with missing observations

7.    create new column, id, using the geo id to help with matching to zipcodes # idk if need to do this actually

8.    filter to only keep counties relevant to NYC

9.    create new column for zipcode by matching to id

Crowding data

*   less_than_1   = Occupied housing units with 1.00 or less occupants per room
*   bet_1to1.5    = Occupied housing units with 1.01 to 1.50 occupants per room
*   more_than_1.5 = Occupied housing units with 1.51 or more occupants per room

It should be noted that the dataset included information about other types of properties but were unoccupied such as rental properties, those listed for sale, properties sold but unoccupied, those designated for migrant workers, and residences that were used occasionally/seasonally/recreationally. The only variable considered in this analysis was vacant properties however it is likely that residences that go unoccupied for several months can become nests for the rat population, increasing sightings in those areas. A more thorough and in-depth analysis should include the other variables provided in the dataset. 

In general, might be losing information with the variables chosen for analysis. During data collection, the variables were further subsetted into age groups and race/ethnicity designations. However for this analysis, the general estimates were taken for the population as a whole in NYC. 

When importing data from 2018 and 2019, there were 4918 census tracts and when importing data from 2020 and 2021, there were 5411 census tracts. The datasets for each year were joined together by geography id to only retain census tracts that were consistent across the years. There may have been adjustments or redfining areas but that could affect analysis.

Analysis



----------------------------------------
make distribution plots (if possible) otherwise do barcharts comparing the different boroughs for variable of interest for 2021

explain how each of these variables may be related to rat sightings and increased presence, go back to the rat paper
possibly compare to the rat distribution 

upload everything to shared repository
